## Are apps built with Nxenv HIPAA compliant?

**They can be! You can build HIPAA compliant apps with Nxenv if you follow the requirements.**

Nxenv doesn't collect any individually identifiable health data, and you can see all the data that Nxenv collects on [our privacy explained page](https://nxenv.dev/privacy-explained). That being said, you are ultimately in control of the data you collect from your users, so we cannot guarantee that all apps built with Nxenv are HIPAA compliant, as in the end, it is up to you as an individual application developer. But there should be no compliance issues with using Nxenv.
