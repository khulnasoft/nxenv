> **warning** **Deprecated**: In SDK 50 and above, Nxenv Webpack has been deprecated in favor of [Nxenv Router](/router/introduction/). Learn how to [migrate from Nxenv Webpack to Nxenv Router](/router/migrate/from-nxenv-webpack/).

To enable Webpack web support, modify your [app config](/workflow/configuration) using the `nxenv.web.bundler` field:

```json app.json
{
  "nxenv": {
    "web": {
      "bundler": "webpack"
    }
  }
}
```

## Customizing the Webpack config

When you run `npx nxenv start --web` or `nxenv nxenvrt:web` the CLI checks to see if your project has a **webpack.config.js** in the root directory. If the file doesn't exist in your project, then Nxenv uses the default `@nxenv/webpack-config` (preferred).

To edit the config, install `@nxenv/webpack-config` as a dev dependency and create a template **webpack.config.js** at the root of your project. This can be done by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx nxenv customize webpack.config.js']} />

You can now make changes to a config object based on the default config and return it for Nxenv CLI to use. Deleting the config will cause Nxenv to fall back to the default again.

If you create a new webpack config or make any changes to it you'll need to restart your webpack dev server by running:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx nxenv start']} />

## Example

```js webpack.config.js
const createNxenvWebpackConfigAsync = require('@nxenv/webpack-config');

// Nxenv CLI will await this method so you can optionally return a promise.
module.nxenvrts = async function (env, argv) {
  const config = await createNxenvWebpackConfigAsync(env, argv);
  // If you want to add a new alias to the config.
  config.resolve.alias['moduleA'] = 'moduleB';

  // Maybe you want to turn off compression in dev mode.
  if (config.mode === 'development') {
    config.devServer.compress = false;
  }

  // Or prevent minimizing the bundle when you build.
  if (config.mode === 'production') {
    config.optimization.minimize = false;
  }

  // Finally return the new config for the CLI to use.
  return config;
};
```

## Editing static files

You can also use `npx nxenv customize` to generate static project files such as **index.html** and so on. These can be used to customize your project more familiarly.

All the files you select from the terminal prompt will be copied to a **web** directory in your project's root directory. Think of this directory as **public** in Create React App. The **web** is used instead of **public** because Nxenv webpack is web-only, the static directory does not work for Android or iOS apps. For mobile platforms, the platform-specific project files are included in **android** and **ios** directories.

Deleting any of these files will cause Nxenv webpack to fall back to their respective default copies.

### Why

- Customizing the favicon icon.
- Adding third-party API code to the `<head/>` in your **index.html**.
