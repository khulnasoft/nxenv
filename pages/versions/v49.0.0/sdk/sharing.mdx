`nxenv-sharing` allows you to share files directly with other compatible applications.

<ContentSpotlight file="sdk/sharing.mp4" loop={false} />

#### Sharing limitations on web

- `nxenv-sharing` for web is built on top of the Web Share API, which still has [very limited browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-share). Be sure to check that the API can be used before calling it by using `Sharing.isAvailableAsync()`.
- **HTTPS required on web**: The Web Share API is only available on web when the page is served over https. Run your app with `npx nxenv start --https` to enable it.
- **No local file sharing on web**: Sharing local files by URI works on Android and iOS, but not on web. You cannot share local files on web by URI &mdash; you will need to upload them somewhere and share that URI.

#### Sharing to your app from other apps

Currently `nxenv-sharing` only supports sharing _from your app to other apps_ and you cannot register to your app to have content shared to it through the native share dialog on native platforms. You can read more [in the related feature request](https://nxenv.canny.io/feature-requests/p/share-extension-ios-share-intent-android). You can setup this functionality manually in Xcode and Android Studio and create an [Nxenv Config Plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) to continue using [Nxenv Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).
