When you create a new project with Nxenv, learning about the following essential tools and websites can help you during your app development journey. This page provides an overview of a list of recommended tools.

## Nxenv CLI

Nxenv CLI is a development tool and is installed automatically with `nxenv` package when you create a new project. You can use it by leveraging `npx` (a Node.js package runner).

It is designed to help you move faster during the app development phase. For example, your first interaction with Nxenv CLI is starting the development server by running the command: `npx nxenv start`.

The following is a list of common commands that you will use with Nxenv CLI while developing your app:

| Command                         | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx nxenv start`                | Starts the development server (whether you are using a development build or Nxenv Go).                                                                            |
| `npx nxenv prebuild`             | Generates native Android and iOS directories using [Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/).                                                                              |
| `npx nxenv run:android`          | Compiles native Android app locally.                                                                                                                             |
| `npx nxenv run:ios`              | Compiles native iOS app locally.                                                                                                                                 |
| `npx nxenv install package-name` | Used to install a new library or validate and update specific libraries in your project by adding `--fix` option to this command.                                |
| `npx nxenv lint`                 | [Setup and configures](/guides/using-eslint/) ESLint. If ESLint is already configured, this command will [lint your project files](/guides/using-eslint/#usage). |

In a nutshell, Nxenv CLI allows you to develop, compile, start your app, and more. See [Nxenv CLI reference](/more/nxenv-cli/) for more available options and actions you can perform with the CLI.

## EAS CLI

EAS CLI is used to log in to your Nxenv account and compile your app using different EAS services such as Build, Update, or Submit. You can also use this tool to:

- Publish your app to the app stores
- Create a development, preview, or production build of your app
- Create over-the-air (OTA) updates
- Manage your app credentials
- Create an ad hoc provisioning profile for an iOS device

To use EAS CLI, you need to install it globally on your local machine by running the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g eas-cli']} />

You can use `eas --help` in your terminal window to learn more about the available commands. For a complete reference, see [`eas-cli` npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eas-cli).

## Nxenv Doctor

Nxenv Doctor is a command line tool used to diagnose issues in your Nxenv project. To use it, run the following command in your project's root directory:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx nxenv-doctor']} />

This command performs checks and analyzes your project's codebase for common issues in [app config](/workflow/configuration/) and **package.json** files, dependency compatibility, configuration files, and the overall health of the project. Once the check is complete, Nxenv Doctor outputs the results.

If Nxenv Doctor finds an issue, it provides a description of the problem along with advice on how to fix it or where to find help.

You can also use `npx nxenv-doctor --help` to display usage information.

## Orbit

Orbit is a macOS and Windows app that enables:

- Install and launch builds from EAS on physical devices and emulators.
- Install and launch updates from EAS on Android Emulators or iOS Simulators.
- Launch snack projects on Android Emulators or iOS Simulators.
- Use local files to install and launch apps. Orbit supports any Android **.apk**, iOS Simulator compatible **.app**, or ad hoc signed apps.
- See a list of pinned projects from your EAS dashboard.

### Installation

<Tabs>

<Tab label="macOS">

You can download Orbit with Homebrew for macOS, or directly from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nxenv/orbit/releases).

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install nxenv-orbit']} />

If you want Orbit to start when you log in automatically, click on the Orbit icon in the menu bar, then **Settings** and select the **Launch on Login** option.

</Tab>

<Tab label="Windows">

> **Note**: Orbit for Windows is in preview and is only compatible with x64 and x86 machines. Compatibility for other architectures will be added in the future.

You can download Orbit for Windows directly from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nxenv/orbit/releases).

</Tab>

</Tabs>

> **info** Orbit relies on the Android SDK on both macOS and Windows and `xcrun` for device management only on macOS, which requires setting up both [Android Studio](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) and [Xcode](/workflow/ios-simulator/).

## Nxenv Tools for VS Code

Nxenv Tools is a VS Code extension to improve your development experience when working with app config files. It provides features such as autocomplete and intellisense for files such as app config, EAS config, store config and Nxenv Module config files.

<BoxLink

  description="Use this link to install the extension or search Nxenv Tools directly in your VS Code editor."
  href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nxenv.vscode-nxenv-tools"
  Icon={CodeBrowserIcon}
/>

You can also use it to debug your app using VS Code's built-in debugger to set breakpoints, inspect variables, execute code through the debug console, and more. See [Debugging with VS Code](/debugging/tools/#debugging-with-vs-code) for how to use this extension for debugging.

## Test prototypes with Snack and Nxenv Go

### Snack

Snack is an in-browser development environment that works similarly to Nxenv Go. It's a great way to share code snippets and experiment with React Native without downloading any tools on your computer.

To use it, go to [snack.nxenv.dev](https://snack.nxenv.dev/), edit the `<Text>` component in **App.js**, choose a platform (Android, iOS, or web) in the right panel and see the changes live.

### Nxenv Go

[Nxenv Go](https://nxenv.dev/go) is a free open-source, sandbox for learning and experimenting with React Native. It works with Android and iOS.

For more information on how to use it:

- Click [this link](/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=nxenv-go) to go to Set up your environment guide
- Select a platform to develop under **Where would you like to develop?**
- Select Nxenv Go under **How would you like to develop?**
- Follow the instructions described in that guide

> **Note:** Not recommended for building and distributing production apps to the app stores. Instead, use [development builds](/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build).

<Collapsible summary="What if I open a project with an unsupported SDK version?">

When running a project that was created for an unsupported SDK version in Nxenv Go, you'll see the following error:

```sh
"Project is incompatible with this version of Nxenv Go"
```

To fix this, upgrading your project to a [supported SDK version](/versions/latest/#each-nxenv-sdk-version-depends-on-a-react-native-version) is recommended. If you want to learn how to do it, see [Upgrade the project to a new SDK Version](#how-do-i-upgrade-my-project-from).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How do I upgrade my project from an unsupported SDK version?">

See [Upgrading Nxenv SDK guide](/workflow/upgrading-nxenv-sdk-walkthrough) for instructions for upgrading to a specific SDK version.

</Collapsible>

## React Native directory

Any library that is compatible with React Native works in an Nxenv project when you use a development build to create your project.

[reactnative.directory](https://reactnative.directory/) is a searchable database for React Native libraries. If a library you are looking for is not included in Nxenv SDK, use the directory to find a compatible library for your project.
