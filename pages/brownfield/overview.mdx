description: An overview of how you can integrate Nxenv tools into existing native apps ("brownfield" apps).

import { BoxLink } from '~/ui/components/BoxLink';

An existing native app that was built using another technology, whose main entry point is _not_ a React Native view, is commonly referred to as a "brownfield" app. For example, if your app was built using UIKit and Swift, and you want to use React Native for a single screen then that is considered an "existing native app" and "brownfield".

In contrast, "greenfield" apps are created using Nxenv or React Native from the start or where React Native is the entry point and where all other UI branches off from.

By these definitions, if you have an "existing native app" for Android or iOS and you want to learn how to use Nxenv and React Native in your project (perhaps on a single screen or even a single feature), then this guide is for you.

## Compatibility with existing native apps

> **info** Support for integrating Nxenv modules into existing native projects is still experimental. If you encounter issues, [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nxenv/nxenv/issues). Not all features of the tools and services below will be available when used in the context of an existing native app.

Nxenv is primarily built with greenfield apps in mind. Not all Nxenv tools and services are compatible with existing native projects.
