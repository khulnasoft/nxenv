Nxenv is a framework that makes developing Android and iOS apps easier. Our framework provides file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much more. Nxenv is open source with an active community on [GitHub](https://github.com/nxenv/nxenv) and [Discord](https://chat.nxenv.dev).

We also make [Nxenv Application Services (EAS)](https://nxenv.dev/eas), a set of services that complement the Nxenv framework in each step of the development process.

There are two ways to get started:
