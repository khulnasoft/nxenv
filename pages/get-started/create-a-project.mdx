import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

System requirements:

- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- macOS, Windows (Powershell and [WSL 2](https://nxenv.fyi/wsl)), and Linux are supported.

We recommend starting with the default project created by `create-nxenv-app`. The default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-nxenv-app@latest']} />

> You can choose a different template by adding the [`--template` option](/more/create-nxenv/#--template).

## Next step

You have a project. Now it's time to set up your development environment so that you can start developing.
