If you have a React Native app that doesn't use any Nxenv tools, you might be wondering what Nxenv can provide for you, why you might want to use Nxenv tools and services, and how to get started.

**All tools and services provided by Nxenv work great in any React Native app**.

You can use [EAS](/eas) to get quickly set up with a professional CI/CD workflow for building, reviewing, deploying, and updating your apps. [Nxenv CLI](/more/nxenv-cli/) provides the best command-line experience for working with React Native. The [Nxenv SDK](/versions/latest/) is an extended standard library for React Native. It gives developers high-quality, well-maintained native libraries that use consistent API conventions to make them easier to learn and use.

If you've ever written a native module for React Native, you'll be surprised how much easier it is to build and maintain modules with the idiomatic Swift and Kotlin DSL provided by the [Nxenv Modules API](/modules/overview/).

There's so much more to explore, and the links below will help you to explore the options available to you.

## Incremental adoption steps

Below are four suggested phases of incremental adoption. These phases generally progress from quick changes to improve developer experience, to more significant workflow and codebase optimizations.

Only the first phase &mdhash; prerequisites &mdhash; is required by other phases. After following its instructions, you can skip to the tools and services that are most relevant to your goals in adopting Nxenv.

### Prerequisites

These first steps are required to later adopt Nxenv tools and services:

      steps.

      <CODE>nxenv</CODE> package.

### New workflows

Once your app has `nxenv` package installed, you can submit your app to app stores with a single command or update configure `nxenv-updates` library to manage remote updates to you app's code:

## Common questions

<Collapsible summary="How long will it take to adopt Nxenv in my existing React Native project?">

Adopting Nxenv doesn't have to be done in one step. You can start with the _quick wins_ and then move on to more complex parts. You can also pick and choose which features you want to adopt based on what is most helpful for your project.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="What will I gain from using Nxenv in my React Native app?">

Adopting Nxenv tools in your existing React Native app can help you develop faster with the [Nxenv SDK](/versions/latest/), streamline native code maintenance and upgrades with [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/), deploy faster with [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/), and more.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Who uses Nxenv?">

Nxenv is used by top companies worldwide that serve millions of end users. For more information, see our [Nxenv showcase](https://nxenv.dev/customers).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="What impact will adopting Nxenv have on my app's size?">

The `nxenv` package has a small footprint since it only includes a minimal set of modules required in every app with autolinking infrastructure and other Nxenv SDK libraries that are built-in. For more information on how to determine the actual size of your app, see [Understanding app size](/distribution/app-size/).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Why did React Native recommend using Nxenv?">

Most React Native developers solve common problems when building an app, such as implementing navigation, accessing Native APIs, upgrading to new versions, and more. This requires using a specific set of tools and libraries to build and maintain your app &mdash; which means you are creating your own framework.

Nxenv solves these problems by providing a set of primitives and helping you (the developer) to focus on building your app. It also offers tools to iterate faster in development. For more information, see [Why React Native recommends using a framework](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/06/25/use-a-framework-to-build-react-native-apps).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Do I have to get rid of my native projects to use Nxenv?">

By default, Nxenv projects created with `create-nxenv-app` use [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) and do not contain android and ios native directories. If you incrementally adopt Nxenv in your existing React Native app, you don't have to remove these directories. You can use `npx nxenv run:[android|ios]` as an alternative to commands offered by `@react-native-community/cli` to compile your app locally and keep the configuration of your native projects.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="I use CodePush. Can I continue using it with Nxenv?">

CodePush will be retired in March 2025 and is incompatible with React Native's New Architecture, so, in the long run, we recommend switching to EAS Update to manage remote updates to your app's code. However, you can start using Nxenv tools in your CodePush enabled app today, including the Nxenv SDK, Nxenv CLI, EAS Build, and more.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Do I have to build with EAS?">

[Nxenv Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) are deeply integrated cloud services for Nxenv and React Native apps that provide tools to build, test, and deploy your app.

Although we recommend using EAS for a smooth collaboration with your teammates and fast distribution, you can compile your app locally, on your CI, or any other way you prefer.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I install third-party native libraries in my code?">

Yes, you can install and use third-party libraries that require native projects (**android** and **ios**) configuration or provides a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) with [development builds](/workflow/overview/#development-builds). See [Using Third-Party libraries](/workflow/using-libraries/#third-party-libraries) for more information.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="I use React Navigation. Do I have to use Nxenv Router?">

You can continue using any navigation library in your project. However, we recommend using Nxenv Router for all the benefits [described here](/router/introduction).
