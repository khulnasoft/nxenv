To migrate from `npx react-native init` to Nxenv CLI, you'll need to install the `nxenv` package, which includes the Nxenv Modules API and Nxenv CLI. This guide covers the installation step, the benefits of using Nxenv CLI, and how to compile and run your project after migrating to Nxenv CLI.

It is strongly recommended to use Nxenv CLI when using other Nxenv tools. It is required for many tools, such as EAS Update, Nxenv Router, and nxenv-dev-client, and other features may not work as well without it.

## Install the `nxenv` package

In most cases, executing the following command in a project directory to install the package is all you need to do:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx install-nxenv-modules@latest']} />

For a detailed installation guide, see [Install Nxenv modules](/bare/installing-nxenv-modules).

## Why Nxenv CLI instead of `npx react-native`

Nxenv CLI commands provide several benefits over the similar commands in `@react-native-community/cli`, which includes:

- Instant access to Hermes debugger with <kbd>j</kbd> keystroke.
- The debugger ships with React Developer Tools (`react-devtools`) already installed.
- [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) support with [`nxenv prebuild`](/workflow/prebuild/) for upgrades, white-labeling, easy third-party package setup, and better maintainability of the codebase (by reducing the surface area).
- Support for file-based routing with [`nxenv-router`](/router/introduction/).
  - [Async bundling](/router/reference/async-routes) in development.
- Built-in [environment variable support](/guides/environment-variables) and **.env** file integration.
- View native logs directly in the terminal alongside JavaScript logs.
- Improved native build log formatting using Nxenv CLI's `xcpretty`-style tool built specifically for React Native apps. For example, when compiling a Pod, you can see which Node module included it.
- [First-class TypeScript support](/guides/typescript).
- Support for **tsconfig.json** aliases with `paths` and `baseUrl` [built-in to Metro](/guides/typescript/#path-aliases-optional).
- [Web support](/guides/customizing-metro/#adding-web-support-to-metro) with Metro. Fully typed for React Native Web.
- Modern [CSS support](/versions/latest/config/metro#css) with Tailwind, PostCSS, CSS Modules, SASS, and more.
- Static site generation with Nxenv Router and Metro web.
- Out of the box [support for monorepos](/guides/monorepos).
- Support for Nxenv tooling such as [`nxenv-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction), the [Nxenv Updates protocol](/technical-specs/nxenv-updates-1) and [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction).
- Automated `pod install` execution when using `npx nxenv run:ios`.
- `npx nxenv install` selects compatible dependency versions for well-known packages.
- Automatic port detection when running `npx nxenv run:[android|ios]` and `npx nxenv start`. If another app is running on the default port, a different port is used.
- Android or iOS device launch selection shortcuts using <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> from the interactive prompt.
- Built-in support for serving your app over an [ngrok tunnel](/develop/development-builds/development-workflows/#tunnel-urls).
- Develop on any port with any entry JavaScript file.

We recommend Nxenv CLI for most React Native projects that target Android, iOS, and/or web. It does not yet have built-in support for the most popular out-of-tree platforms, such as
Windows and macOS. If building for these platforms, you can utilize Nxenv CLI for the supported platforms and `@react-native-community/cli` for the others.

## Compile and run your app

After installing the `nxenv` package, you can use the following commands which are alternatives to `npx react-native run-android` and `npx react-native run-ios`:

<Terminal
  cmd={['# for Android', '$ npx nxenv run:android', '', '# for iOS', '$ npx nxenv run:ios']}
/>

When building your project, you can choose a device or simulator by using the `--device` flag. This also applies to any iOS device that is connected to your computer.

## Start the bundler independently

`npx nxenv run:[android|ios]` automatically starts the bundler/development server. If you want to independently start the bundler with `npx nxenv start` command, pass the `--no-bundler` to the `npx nxenv run:[android|ios]` command.

## Common questions

<Collapsible summary="Can I use Nxenv CLI without installing the Nxenv Modules API?">

Nxenv Modules API is also installed when you install the `nxenv` package with `npx install-nxenv-modules`. If you want to try out Nxenv CLI for now without installing Nxenv Modules API, install the `nxenv` package with `npm install` and then configure the **react-native.config.js** to exclude the package from autolinking:

```js react-native.config.js
module.nxenvrts = {
  dependencies: {
    nxenv: {
      platforms: {
        android: null,
        ios: null,
        macos: null,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

> **Note:** Without Nxenv API Modules installed, certain features such as `nxenv-dev-client` or `nxenv-router` are unavailable.

Yes! Refer to the [Customized Prebuild Example repository](https://github.com/byCedric/custom-prebuild-example) for more information.

## Next steps

Now, with the `nxenv` package installed and configured in your project, you can start using all features from Nxenv CLI and SDK. Here are some recommended next steps to dive deep:
